# Cheaper Void Miners for GTNH

### What does this mod do?
Adds a new set of void miners (Void Miner EX) from LV to EV that output 8, 16, 32, and 64 ores per second. These void miners cannot accept noble gas input for boosting e.g. Oganesson.

### Motivation
This was made for my no-ae2 run. Due to the insane dedicated processing line requirements this entails, bottlenecking on raw materials is not easily remedied especially as you go progress tiers. Providing free infinite ores near the beginning of the game is a significant balance change that enables you to quickly build dedicated processing lines right out of the gate. It also lets you quickly set up entirely new processing lines from scratch without spamming a gagillion bees or crops.

This goes against the spirit of GTNH being hardcore, but is similar to other games like Satisfactory or Project Dyson Sphere that do not have magic AE2 nonsense.
